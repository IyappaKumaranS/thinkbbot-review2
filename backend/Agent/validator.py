        Use the COSTAR framework to validate the following startup idea.

        C (Context): 
        The user has provided a startup idea. 
        Your task is to evaluate its real-world potential across multiple key dimensions.
        
        Input Idea: "{self.text_data}"
        
        Competitor Analysis:
        Average Similarity with Competitors: {avg_similarity}%
        Top Similar Competitors:
        {competitor_context}

        O (Objective): 
        Provide a **quantitative validation** of the idea based on competitor analysis:
        
        - Uniqueness: Score INVERSELY based on competitor similarity
          * If avg similarity > 80%: Score 1-3 (very similar to existing solutions)
          * If avg similarity 60-80%: Score 3-5 (somewhat similar)
          * If avg similarity 40-60%: Score 5-7 (moderately unique)
          * If avg similarity < 40%: Score 7-10 (highly unique)
        
        - Market Opportunity: Score INVERSELY based on number of similar competitors
          * Many very similar competitors (>3): Score 1-4 (saturated market)
          * Few similar competitors (1-3): Score 4-7 (competitive but with space)
          * No direct competitors: Score 7-10 (blue ocean opportunity)
        
        - Feasibility: Score based on:
          * Technical complexity relative to existing solutions
          * Resource requirements
          * Implementation challenges
        
        - Market Trend & Timing: Consider
          * Current market direction
          * Technology readiness
          * User readiness for the solution
        
        - Scalability: Evaluate
          * Growth potential
          * Market size
          * Expansion possibilities
        
        - Problem Relevance: Assess
          * Pain point severity
          * Target market size
          * Urgency of the solution

        S (Style): 
        - Use structured analysis, be concise and clear.
        - Focus on providing scores rather than long paragraphs.
        - Keep each score strictly numeric (0â€“10).

        T (Tone): 
        Professional, objective, and evaluation-focused.
        Avoid exaggeration or marketing tone.

        A (Audience): 
        Startup founders, product managers, and investors looking to validate startup ideas.

        R (Response): 
        Return output in strict JSON format:
        {{
          "validation_scores": {{
            "uniqueness": <score_out_of_10>,
            "feasibility": <score_out_of_10>,
            "market_trend": <score_out_of_10>,
            "scalability": <score_out_of_10>,
            "problem_relevance": <score_out_of_10>,

          }},
          "overall_score": <total_score_out_of_100>
        }}

        Rules:
        - Base uniqueness and market_trend scores INVERSELY on competitor similarity
        - Higher similarity = LOWER uniqueness score
        - Higher similarity = LOWER market opportunity score
        - Each attribute must have an integer score from 0 to 10
        - "overall_score" must be the sum of all attributes, out of 100
        - Do not include explanations, only return JSON
        - Ensure scores reflect the competitive landscape accurately
